# python-high-volume-address-validation-library

## Introduction

This program is a wrapper around [Address Validation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation) enabling it to be processed in high volume which can be useful for many scenarios.

![High-Level-overview](/doc_images/High-Volume-Address-Validation-overview.png)

The program takes a `csv` file. It then uses the API key configured in `config.yaml` to start the processing of the addresses.

## Overview

### Authentication

You will need an API Key to call the Address Validation API.
[Enable the Address Validation API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/addressvalidation.googleapis.com) and [generate your API](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started#api-key) key by following instructions here.

### Running Modes
  
 Running modes are essentially different scenarios or use cases under which the software can be run. There are three running modes for the software which can all be configured using the config.yaml deescribed in the next section:

 Details of the elements we discuss in this section can be found in the [validateAddress object reference guide](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/reference/rest/v1/TopLevel/validateAddress)

1. ### Test Mode : 1  

      In test mode you can store more details from the Address Validation API response .

      - place_ID
      - latlong
      - formatted_address
      - postal_address
      - verdict
      - address_type
      - usps_data
      - address_components
  
> **Note:** This is an extrmely permissive mode and should be avoided to be used for most scenarios. Only use case where this mode can be used is for testing and for very limited number of addresses. The responses have to be deleted within 15 days.

2. ### Production mode -Users : 2 (default)

      A Production mode <ins>not</ins> initiated after user/human interaction, only minimal data elements are allowed to be stored as per [Google Maps Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms). Typically involves successive and multiple programmatic requests to Address Validation API.

      - place_ID
      - latlong
      - verdict
      - address_components

> **Note:** All the data elements in this mode can only be cached for a maximum of 30 days and >   must be deleted afterwords.Only place_ID can be stored indefinitely.

3. ### Production mode -NoUsers : 3

      a Production mode initiated after user/human interaction, some more data may be cached for the unique purpose of the user completing his singular task.

    - place_ID

- Update the mode in `config.yaml` file:

### config.yaml

The program ships with a config.yaml file using which several parameters of the library can be tweaked.

***Location of the input address file***

```
address_file : './tests/addresses.csv'   
```

***Address fields***
The csv file can have either the address in one single column or it can be split across multiple columns like [house number, street name, zipcode, city, state] using this property. In the following field configure all the columns which constituate the
address and the program will construct the address by concattinating the fields.

```
   Provide the columns which needs to be concatinated to get the address column_numbers eg [3,4,5,6,7]  
```

***API KEY***
Provide the APIkey retrieved from console
```api_key :```

***Advanced configurations***

***Separator*** Set the separator in the file with which to create the final address. By default it is comma(,). but can be updated here.
separator : ","  

***Shelve db file:*** This is a temporary file created to maintain persistance for a long runninng process.
```shelve_db : addresses```

### Key features

- Maintains QPM limits set by the Address Validation API
- Async code and maintains state
- Checks for duplicates and runs repeated addresses only once
- Generates a duplication report which shows which addresses are duplicated and how often
- Modes help create parity with Terms of Service

## Install and run

- Requires `python3` and `PyYAML`:
  
  `brew install python3`  
  `brew install PyYAML`
  
- Install: python-high-volume-address-validation-library software also requires to have [google-maps-services-python](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python) installed, the latest version that includes Address Validation API:
  `
  pip3 install googlemaps
  `

- Update `config.yaml` file in with your API key, `csv` output path, and mode in which to run the library (see "Running Modes" section):

- Run:  
  `
  python3 main.py
  `

## Code Structure

  First the program will read the configuration located in `config.yaml`. `config.yaml` has the location of the address file which by default is `addresses.csv`.

  `main.py` will orchestrate across other functions and read the
  `csv` file line by line and insert into a persistant Datastructure
  called `address` (by default) which is of type [Shelve](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html)

  Then a second function will pick up the addresses in the shelve object and call the [Address
  Validation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation)

  The response from the Address Validation API will be stored back in the `shelve`  Object.
  Finally a `csv` file will be exported from the `shelve` object.

  The software works in three modes. You can set the mode to comply with [Google Maps Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms), by configuring the `config.yaml` file corresponding to the use case under which this is run.

### Overall Flow of logic

- Reads a `csv` file
- Constructs the address as per configuration
- Stores the formatted addresses in a `shelve` object. This is done to make the program more resilient and async.
- The library then picks up addresses one by one from the `shelve` object and call the Address Validation API
- It gets the response back, parse it and store configured values back to the `shelve` object
- After all the addresses are inserted back to the datastructure, another piece of code executes and exports the data in a `csv` file
- Once the program is executed, it stores the [geocode](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/requests-validate-address#response) and [`place ID`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id) against each given address and exports it in a `csv` file.

## Output

  This program outputs a CSV file. Based on the mode selected above, the contents of the CSV file changes.

  It will also output a duplication csv file which reports all the addresses which were duplicates in the input request.
